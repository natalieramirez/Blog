                    Hello! My name is Natalie Ramirez and this is a website that
                    is all about me. Find anything you want to know about me here.
                    Natlie is a poopy head.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    With this website, you can know what Sports and athletics I am doing
                    during quarantine and during the school year, my freshman and sophomore 
                    school stats, and other fun things like how I am keeping busy during 
                    this time doing projects such as this one. 
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Summer is about to begin! So you know what that means... a lot of sitting
                    around and doing nothing. Yeah, quarantine sucks, but this website will not
                    only be talking about me but other ways you can keep busy! Have fun and HAGS :)
